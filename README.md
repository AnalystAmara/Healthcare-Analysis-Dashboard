## Design Choices
* Top cards for KPIs: Important metrics like Patient Count, LOS, Adherence, and Satisfaction are placed prominently at the top for immediate visibility.
* Bar charts: Used for clear category comparisons (e.g., patient count by age, diagnosis).
* Pie chart: Visualizes discharge distribution, making proportional analysis quick.
* Slicers: Gender, Age Group, Diagnosis, and Discharge Destination filters enhance interactivity, allowing users to drill down easily.
* Color scheme: A green and blue palette was chosen to reflect a healthcare theme, ensuring consistency and clarity.
## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive, user-friendly summary of patient data, enabling quick insight into key healthcare metrics. With small enhancements (e.g., trend lines, larger labels), it can further improve clarity and impact.
